# Iris Flower Species Classification

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of a Logistic Regression model for classifying Iris flower species based on various features.

## Contents

1. **Importing Libraries:**
   - Importing necessary libraries for data visualization, logistic regression, and metrics calculation.

2. **Loading the Dataset:**
   - Loading the Iris dataset from the Seaborn library and displaying the first few rows.

3. **Preparing the Training Set:**
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function.

4. **Training the Model:**
   - Creating an instance of the Logistic Regression model and training it with the training set.

5. **Testing the Model:**
   - Using the trained model to make predictions on the test set.

6. **Visualizing Predictions
